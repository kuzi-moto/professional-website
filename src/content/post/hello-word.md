Welcome to the first post of my blog! It was created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a static site generator, and deployed with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). The entire site contents and Docker image can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/kuzi-moto/professional-website).

My name is Kuzma Fesenko and I've been in IT for just over seven years. I'm starting this blog to document some of the interesting things I encounter in my work, or personal projects that may be useful to someone else. It will also serve as a sort of knowledge base for information that I refer to frequently but not enough to remember. I have relied on information from others for a long time so I'm hoping to I can begin to give back.

I imagine this blog will appeal mostly to other people working in IT, or interested in topics related to IT. Comments should be up shortly after this post goes up, assuming it's not working already. I encourage anyone to write something, even if it's just to say if something was helpful. Comments won't require an account/signup to reduce friction to actually posting a comment. Additionally, if you want to submit an issue with a post or something on my site, feel free to do so at the site repository mentioned in the first paragraph.

My main goal for this will be to write one to two posts a month, but hopefully more depending on how many interesting things I come across to write about. Usually in IT there isn't any shortage of interesting topics so I don't foresee that being an issue.

## About This Site

The goal of this site is to provide helpful, interesting, or otherwise insightful ideas around technology and computer-y related things.

This site is a labor of love, and I have done all of the design work, as well as the "code" to generate it. It was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a static site generator, and runs on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). The source will be available soon!

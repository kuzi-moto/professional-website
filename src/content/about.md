Hey! I'm Kuzma Fesenko and you have reached my personal site. This site is used to share my thoughts and information about the world of IT and technology in general.

I've had a lifelong interest in computers, and a fascination with how things work. I thoroughly enjoy helping solve others IT problems. Currently I work for [Episerver](https://www.episerver.com/) as an Associate System Administrator, helping to support the organization across several continents. I use PowerShell for tedious tasks and to implement automation whenever possible.

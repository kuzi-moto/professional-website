## About Me

Hello, I'm Kuzma Fesenko. By day, I'm a system administrator for [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/), but by night I'm a researcher and aspiring blogger. Much of my free time is spent tinkering and playing with fun technology. My interest in computers comes second only to my amazing family.

I had some goals in mind while creating this site. Primarily it is to share (hopefully) useful information that others may learn from. Secondary goals include learning to maintain a site, become a better writer, and to develop my critical thinking abilities.

## About This Site

The goal of this site is to provide helpful, interesting, or otherwise insightful ideas around technology and computer-y things.

This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), runs on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), eventually the source will be available on my personal [git server](https://git.kuzmafesenko.com).
